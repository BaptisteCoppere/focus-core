## Page pattern

- With JavaScript, many possibilities exists  in order to build pages. 
- With far more interactions, loading strategies, client side validation, animations, interactive graphs.


## Framework 0.1:  First objective

The objective of the first version of the JavaScript Framework was to be able to build application with the same pattern as before.

- Search pages
- Result pages (often combine with a search one)
- List pages (Read, write)
- Detail pages (Read, write)

Even if these pages are not so different from the previous one (in the rendering aspect), the way we build the is completely different. The interactions possibilities are completly differents.

## Framework 0.1: Second objective

- The second objective was to be able to _easily_ build pages which coule be different from the usual patterns.
- Or to create new patterns or improve existing one.
