## Core Objects

The Framework is build on the top of an other lightweight JavaScript framework: [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).
The main goal of _Backbone_ is to provide concepts an a really flexible skeleton in order to build JavaScript applications.
The application objects try to match an MVC pattern with many concepts:

- [Model](/first_steps/model.md)
- [Collection](/first_steps/collection.md)
- [View](/first_steps/view.md)
- [Template](/first_steps/template.md)
- [Service](/first_steps/service.md)
- [Router](/first_steps/router.md)
